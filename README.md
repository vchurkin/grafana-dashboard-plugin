# Grafana Dashboard Plugin

Plugin for automatic dashboards creation in [Grafana](https://grafana.com)

# Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to ease support and maintenance of dashboards in grafana. 

We, a team at Yandex.Money, have many dashboards for our projects, and it's often hard to answer these questions:

* Who created the dashboard?
* What it's purpose?
* Is it working correctly?
* How can i reuse some dashboards?

So, to come up to the solution to these answers, we do as following:

* Store dashboards in vcs with application code
* Have CI jobs for updating dashboards contents
* Use [Grafana Dashboard Dsl](https://github.com/yandex-money-tech/grafana-dashboard-dsl) for declaring dashboards

These methods of creating and maintaining dashboards allow us:

* See author and changes made in particular dashboards
* Ease of understanding what metrics used for monitoring application
* In case of broken dashboard quickly understand and fix the problems
* Reuse parts of whole contents of dashboards in other application

# Usage

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.yandex.money.tech.grafana-dashboard-plugin' version '2.0.5'
}

grafana {
    // Required, URL to Grafana
    url = 'https://grafana.yamoney.ru'
    
    // Required, Grafana username
    user = 'testUser'
    
    // Required, Grafana user password
    password = 'test'
    
    // Directory with dashboards descriptions, default is: 'grafana'
    dir = 'grafana'
    
    // Folder id to save to, default is: '0'
    folderId = '0'
    
    // Overwrite existing dashboards, default is: true    
    overwrite = true
    
    // Additional classpath to use during dashboard scripts evaluation
    classpath = null
    
    // Library name with additional dashboard
    additionalDashboardLibraries = ['dashboards-library']
}
```

# How does it work?

The plugin supports two work scenarios.
1. Scans the folder, configured in settings (grafana.dir)
2. Scans the libraries, configured in settings (grafana.additionalDashboardLibraries)

Scans for files with dashboards description, in following formats:

* JSON (file extension `.json`)
* Kotlin Script (file extension `.kts`)

Then use task called `uploadGrafanaDashboards` to publish your dashboards

## JSON

Simple format, uploaded to grafana as is.
You can check up description in Grafana -> Dashboard -> Settings -> JSON Model.

## Kotlin Script

For this format, plugin executes files with kotlin code and expects that
an output is a description of dashboards in JSON format.

It is most useful when used with another one of our projects: [Grafana Dashboard Dsl](https://github.com/yandex-money-tech/grafana-dashboard-dsl)

SourceSet is separated into grafanaFromLibrary and grafanaFromDir for the purpoce to announce different versions of dsl.
Just add a dependency to build script, in the `grafanaFromDirCompile` and `grafanaFromLibraryCompile` source set, 
as follows:

```groovy
dependencies {
    grafanaFromDirCompile 'com.yandex.money.tech:grafana-dashboard-dsl:1.2.0'
    grafanaFromLibraryCompile 'com.yandex.money.tech:grafana-dashboard-dsl:1.1.0'
}
```

# How to contribute?

Just fork the repo and send us a pull request.

Make sure your branch builds without any warnings/issues.

# How to build?

See configuration for Travis (`.travis.yml`) or AppVeyor (`appveyor.yml`).
There are two gradle projects in this repository:

* Files `build.gradle`, `gradlew`, `gradle/wrapper` is for internal use in Yandex.Money infrastructure
* Files `build-public.gradle`, `gradlew-public`, `gradle-public/wrapper` are for public use

# Importing into IntelliJ IDEA

Unfortunately, at this moment, intellij does not support this build configuration,
so you have to change some files before importing:

* Move `gradle-public/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` into `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
* Move `build-public.gradle` into `build.gradle`

Vote for this issue [IDEA-199116](https://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/IDEA-199116), to make intellij support these types of configuration.
